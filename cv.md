 *The main reason of changing of my professional way is understanding what I really want
 from my life. I want to be around people who can think outside the box, who has a diverse 
 headspace, who moves away from common stereotypes. According to my life, my age and professional
 background I am clearly aware what I must do for achieving my goals. I work hard, I am very
 patient person, careful to details, persistent and I can get knowledge by myself.
As for me this is not general hype “to get into belarusian IT-sphere” for me this is the best
 opportunity to become part of a large international team and the best opportunity to develop myself.*
